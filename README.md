# <XGenerator-Readme.md>

## Description

- As a USER I wanted to create a Readme dynamically

- This project was built to make life easier by taking the heavy lifting off of the user and creating a reusable template for multiple uses.

- This project does not completely solve the time contraint but  does gives several of the minutes used back to the user. 

- I learned a way to dynamically generate the readme and how to use the 'require' and the inquirer dependency
